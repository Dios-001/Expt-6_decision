## Introduction

This experiment focuses on implementing various decision-making statements and loops in C++. Each program demonstrates a unique aspect of control flow, including `if-else`, `while`, `do-while`, and nested loops.

## Programs Overview

### Program 1: While Loop from 1 to 20

**Logic:**  
This program uses a `while` loop to print numbers from 1 to 20. It demonstrates the basic structure of a `while` loop, where the condition is checked before executing the loop body.

### Program 2: Do-While Loop Example

**Logic:**  
This program illustrates the use of a `do-while` loop. Unlike a `while` loop, a `do-while` loop guarantees that the loop body is executed at least once before the condition is checked.

### Program 3: Flipped Floyd's Triangle

**Logic:**  
This program generates a flipped version of Floyd's Triangle using nested loops. It uses `for` loops to print a pattern of numbers in a triangular format, starting with the maximum width and reducing it in each subsequent row.

### Program 4: Floyd's Triangle

**Logic:**  
This program constructs Floyd's Triangle using nested `for` loops. The numbers are printed in a right-angled triangular format, starting from 1 at the top and continuing sequentially.

### Program 5: Password Check with While Loop

**Logic:**  
This program prompts the user to enter a password and uses a `while` loop to keep asking for input until the correct password is entered. It demonstrates how loops can be used for validation purposes.

### Program 6: Reverse Star Pattern

**Logic:**  
This program prints a reverse star pattern, decreasing the number of stars in each row. It uses nested loops to control the number of stars printed and the number of rows.

### Program 7: Star Pattern

**Logic:**  
This program creates a basic star pattern with a fixed number of rows and columns using nested loops. It's a simple example of using loops to generate patterns.

### Program 8: Star Pyramid

**Logic:**  
This program generates a star pyramid with a center alignment. It uses nested loops where the outer loop controls the rows, and the inner loops manage spaces and star printing for each row.

These programs are a great way to understand the practical application of loops and decision-making statements in C++. Explore each program to get a deeper insight into how control structures work in real-world scenarios.
